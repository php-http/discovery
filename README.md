## Backwards compatibility promise

The backwards compatibility promise does not include classes marked with the `@internal` annotation. Nor does it
include the default order of which the strategies are executed. However we do promise that we do not remove any strategies 
and we will also not remove any classes in the `CommonClassesStrategy`. We do also promise to support the following Puli versions: 

* 1.0.0-beta10
